This repository hosts python code and data of publication 'Effect of Acoustic Source Model on the Perception of Auditory Envelopment at Non-Ideal Listener Positions'.

Dependencies:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

With a python environment that is ready to go, these scripts will do the following:  
  
*plotExperimentResults.py*:  plots statistics of experiment results with visualizations of conditions.   
*plotGammatone_IC_ILD.py*: plots interaural coherence and level difference over frequency for specified conditions of the experiment.  
*sweetAreaLEVBinaural.py*: plots interaural cues across a simulated listening area for multi-source arrangements.  
  
All plots are kindly saved to 'Figures' subfolder, do not expect any pop-up figure windows.
