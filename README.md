# JASA_EL_LEV
This repository hosts python code and data of publication 'Effect of Acoustic Source Model on the Perception of Auditory Envelopment at Non-Ideal Listener Positions'.

Dependencies:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

Should you have a python environment ready with the dependencies, the scripts will do the following:  
  
plotExperimentResults.py: reads and plots statistics of anonymized experiment results (json files).   
plotGammatone_IC_ILD.py: plots interaural coherence and level difference over frequency for selected conditions of the experiment.  
sweetAreaLEVBinaural.py: plots interaural cues across the listening area for multi-source arrangements.  
  
All plots are kindly saved to 'Figures' subfolder! Do not expect any pop-up figure windows.
