# JASA_EL_LEV
This repository hosts python code and data of publication 'Surrounding line sources optimally reproduce diffuse envelopment at off-center listening positions'.

Dependencies:
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* joblib
  
  
*plotExperimentResults.py*:  
plots statistics of experiment results with visualizations of conditions.  
  
*plotGammatone_IC_ILD.py*:  
plots interaural coherence and level difference over frequency for specified conditions of the experiment.  
  
*sweetAreaLEVBinaural.py*:  
plots interaural cues across a simulated listening area for multi-source arrangements.    
  
All plots are directly saved to the 'Figures' subfolder without pop-up figure windows.
